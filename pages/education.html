  <p>I have enrolled in 6 undergraduate colleges, and attended courses regularly over a timeline that spanned about a decade. I continued taking undergraduate courses at a few other colleges after graduating&#x2014;enough to attain a graduate degree perhaps, but alas, I did not approach these courses in any way that gave the official paperwork I could add to a resume.</p>
  <p>My previous degree-seeking pursuits led me to choose things that met requirements, but after graduation, as I tried to implement more ambitious projects, I felt like my main weapon for problem solving was trial and error&#x2014;an Ok process sometimes, but probably not a great strategy for professional work.  Suffice it to say, in school, I worried about doing well, and I, like any human being, delighted in the reinforcement (grades) that I was doing well. Because of this, I, like many folks, avoided choosing anything too rigorous or absent from my strengths. After graduation, I didn't care about grades or progress, so I started taking classes that I had avoided and came to find that I appreciated this setup much more. </p>
  <p>Outcome is something the conscious mind will fixate on, but it is a suspicious endeavor, steeped in pretense. That is not a conclusion I have come through learning and observation, rather, this is something I feel in my gut after one-third of my life spent trying to make things professionally. I have taught college-level courses as an adjunct, and in dealing with that epiphany I  gained in my experience as a learner, I would  pose the following question to my students at some point in the semester,  "Would you rather do good work for a C, or mediocre work for an A?"</p>
  <p>I don't fault the near unanimity that students, if not begrudgingly, admitted a preference for grades, because the truth is, we live in an world concerned by status, even while many of us know it is only a veneer. But design as an occupation has a more humble task. It is a way of <em>working thoughtfully</em>&#x2014;a considered process that is revised continually. The more obscure, wide, and varied the skills of a designer, the potential for meaningful, if not profound work becomes so much greater.</p>
  <p>It took me a lot of observation in my career to learn that outcomes can usually be veneered to look exactly the same, but how one traveled the path that led to the outcome can't helped but be baked into the soul of the work.</p>
  <p>It took me a decade before I felt confident that I had developed techniques more useful than <em>insert popular framework or paradigm</em>. Imagine the organic farmer that organizes and schedules and delivers a product that adheres to, and holds a deep concern for her patrons. To deliver that product, she employs a trove of useful skills (more than the average farmer) and must often be creative in the face of budgets and circumstance and mission to deliver something wholesome without cutting corners. This is an occupation that requires devising, making and fixing things constantly. Any practitioner that cannot get into the grit of their project and fix going on is the same to me&#x2014;the manipulation you did to the environment to grow a carrot produced something that looks like a carrot, but it isn't quite the real thing. NOTE: people seem to care more about wanting something to look appealing than healthy and sustaining, and can't seem to quit {link to fb/IG post}</p>
  <p>Juxtapose that with my typical experience with people who&#x2014;and I won't belabor this point because it is nearly clich&#xE9;&#x2014;call themselves 'designers'. The vast majority are vain and selfish in many aspects of their work, and have the nerve to write <q>culture</q> and <q>branding</q> adjacent to one another. This is frustrating not because those are shitty traits, but because they actually went to school, ostensibly, to learn how to do things better.</p>
  <p>[1] I learned by bouncing around the chicago schools system, that often adjuncts teach at several institutions. The same accredited course which can be taught by the same instructor at two different schools. It seems, the only difference is what the student pays, which can be extreme.</p>
