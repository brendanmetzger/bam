# Diatom

This template framework is merely a starting point. The `kernal.php` file aims to be everything necessary to begin making a website. There are additional classes to ensure that most goals can be met when it comes to authoring a content-based site.

## Use cases

### Simple

If a website is, say, 10 pages of basic content, you are basically done, just hone your homepage in `pages/index.html`, add a `yield` spot for swapping in new pages, such as `pages/about.html`. Proceed to make the pages, and remember that you don't need to add all the boilerplate, because that will exist in `pages/index.html`

#### Things you can do out of the box
- use template variables
- embed partial templates
- insert custom javascript and css wherever you want


### More Involved

If you need to add authorship capabilities for others without access, there are facilities for that.
